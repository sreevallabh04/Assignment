## Usage Guide

(Detailed usage instructions will be added as the project develops)

## Smart Assign Logic

The Smart Assign feature automatically assigns tasks to the user with the fewest active tasks, balancing the workload across the team.

## Conflict Handling

When two users edit the same task simultaneously, the application detects the conflict and presents both versions, allowing users to choose between merging the changes or overwriting with one version.
